                <h1>Random Shots</h1>
                <p>A pair of tiny paperfold origami found in a MTR station.
                    <br>
                    The two bird origami were in different postures, both wanting to fly. I liked how it was found as a
                    suprise find.

                <p>Series of the traditional Fire Dragon Dance in Tai Hang, Hong Kong.
                    <br> the whole dance takes hours and the dragon made out of incense sticks were a memorable sight.
                    <br> I could feel their pride as they dance through the streets.

                <p>Series of pictures of my home, taken during a typhoon.
                    <br>
                    The time was supposed to be noon, but due to the typhoon, the environment made the house very dark
                    without any lights.
                    <br> It felt very suppressive, like an exaggreated form of being stuck at home, thus the time
                    "homeridden".
